# This is a placeholder for a zero-knowledge ledger implementation.
# A real zkLedger would use advanced cryptography to create a
# confidential ledger where transaction details (amounts, parties)
# are hidden, but proofs ensure the integrity of the system.
# The core components would include:
# 1. Pedersen Commitments for confidential amounts.
# 2. Bulletproofs for range proofs (proving amounts are non-negative).
# 3. Viewing keys for auditors to view confidential data.
